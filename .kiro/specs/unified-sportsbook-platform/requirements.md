# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a unified sports betting analytics platform that consolidates multiple ML-driven prediction engines (NFL, NCAA, NBA, UFC) into a single, user-friendly interface. The platform will feature an admin dashboard for running comprehensive intelligence reports with injury tracking, line movements, and credibility scoring, paired with a simplified client-facing UI that presents only essential betting information optimized for ease of use by older adults and high-stakes bettors.

## Glossary

- **Publishing System**: The automated mechanism that transfers approved reports from the Admin Dashboard to the Client Portal with data simplification
- **Intelligence Update**: Real-time information about fighters or players including injuries, training reports, weight cuts, or other factors affecting performance
- **Risk Score**: A numerical rating (0-100) indicating the risk level of betting on a particular fighter or player, where higher scores indicate higher risk
- **Confidence Score**: A percentage (0-100%) indicating the system's confidence in a particular pick
- **Credibility Rating**: A percentage indicating the reliability of an intelligence source (e.g., official sources 95%, verified social media 85%, forum posts 70%)
- **Line Movement**: Changes in betting odds over time, tracked to identify sharp money and value opportunities
- **Pick Hierarchy**: Classification of picks by importance (Lock of the Week, Featured Picks, High Confidence, Medium Confidence, Value Plays)
- **Player Props**: Betting markets on individual player statistics (e.g., passing yards, receptions, touchdowns)
